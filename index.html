                            God created man, male and female, based on his own image”- Genesis KJV version (King James Version - officially published Bible by the British royal family in 1611) God ordered all other creatures including angels must bow to humankind (Genesis Book)
At the time God created man, he created both men and women. The male was named Lord Adam, the female was named Lord Lilith and they were two equal creatures that created the image of God. Lilith was created by God with all the blessings: beautiful, talented, independent, assertive, struggling for her own rights. With her personality, she did not submit to the supremacy and theocracy imposed by dominant Adam. In one argument, angry with Adam's attitude, Lilith blurted the name of God (יהוה in Hebrew, Latin transliteration is YHWH - pronounced "Yahweh" or "Jehovah" means "I am who I am"), then Lilith left. Discontent with the injustice of God, Lilith turned to Samael - Angel of Death, also known as Satan, a Seraphim following Lucifer - The Lightbringer (or The Morning Star, the Angel vowed that he would not kneeling before anyone but God) and other Seraphims like Beelzebub, Asmodeus, Leviathan, Astaroth to against God in the War in Heaven (for not accepting to bow to humankind)In this situation, God gave strength to the archangel Michael by sword and armor, and the Longinus spear to fight Lucifer and the rebellious angels. Lucifer and other Seraphim such as Abaddon, Asmodeus, Leviathan, Astaroth failed and were banished to hell even they were stronger but due to the disparity in numbers and unable to resist Michael's strength given by God. Lucifer was defeated in a duel with Michael, body was speared by Longinus spear and was knocked out of High Heaven. (According to Isaiah, Jesus said that he saw Lucifer in the form of a dragon being knocked to the ground like a lightning bolt).When Lucifer failed and were pushed out of High Heaven to the hell with 133,306,668 other angels (1/3 angels), Lilith followed them, then had babies with Samael - Satan, countless demons. That's why Lilith was dubbed the "Mother of demons". (* Since then, Lilith has been worshiped by heretical organizations, becoming the goddess of sexual desire. Many heresy ceremonies performed sexual acts in honor of Lilith. Lilith was usually associated with a snake, sometimes she was portrayed as a half-woman, half -serpent.) When Lilith left Adam alone, feeling so lonely, Adam went looking for God and told him: "God, you created me. The woman you created with me has left!" God though: “It is not good for a man to live alone. I will make him a mate.” God made Adam fell into deep sleep. While Adam slept, God pulled a rib from Adam's body and put the flesh there. And from that rib of Adam, God created a woman. Adam named her Eva and loved her deeply. They began their lives in the garden that God had created for them. It was a land of rivers and gems, full of flowering trees and lush fruits, and God named it Eden. The Lord said to Adam and Eve: "You may eat all the fruit trees in the garden, but you are allowed neither eat nor touch the tree in the middle of the garden. If you disobey my words, you will surely die." When the War in Heaven ended, God sent three angels named Senoy, Sansenoy and Semangelof to search for Lilith. God said: "Bring Lilith back. If she's back, it's good then. If not, use force." The three angels found Lilith hiding in a cave on the edge of the Dead Sea. They said: "Lilith, the Supreme create you commanded you to return to your husband immediately. Otherwise, we will kill your 100 demon children every day. Lilith replied: "Go ahead and I'll strangle the human' babies later. When I do, boys will be dead before they are 8 days old and girls will be dead before 20 days old. Let's compromise, if I see your name on the child's necklace, I will no longer have the power to harm that child. " 3 angels Senoy (סנוי), Sansenoy (סנסנוי) and Semangelof (וסמנגלוף) found that they could not ask for anything more from Lilith then they returned. (** The above story also explains why Jews often make babies wear a pendant engraved with the names of the three angels to protect them from being harmed by the demon god Lilith) Lilith was jealous of God's love for Adam, as she was also the first creature he created in human form Lilith sneaked back to Eden garden, using magic learned from Samael - Satan, transfo.rmed into a snake to try to harm Adam and Eve. And then Lilith heard the story of two special fruit trees in the middle of the Garden of Eden: "The Fruit of Life - on the tree of Life, the person who eats it will live forever, never die" "Forbidden Fruit - on the Tree of Knowledge, the person who eats it can understand Good - Evil, opens the mind, but he will lose immortality in return." This is also the fruit that God forbids to touch. Lilith went to the tree of Life to eat Fruit of Life. Upon seeing the Tree of Knowledge nearby, Lilith devised a plan to regain God's love. Lilith thought that as long as Adam and Eve eat the fruit of the Forbidden, they would die as the Lord said and God would love only Lilith - the only remaining creature created in the Lord's form. One day, Lilith in the form of a snake seduced Eva - a carefree, innocent person - and Adam to approach the Tree of Knowledge and asked: "Did the Lord tell you not to eat the fruit trees in this garden?" Eva answered: "No, the Lord allowed us to eat all the fruit trees in the garden, except the tree in the middle of the garden, God told us not to eat, nor to touch. If we disobey, we would definitely die. " The snake said, "No, you won't die when eating that fruit! It's the Tree of Knowledge. God forbids because God knows if you eat that fruit, then the mind will be opened, you'll know good and evil just like God." The snake sounded reasonable, Eva looked up at the forbidden tree. How beautiful the fruit was, it looked so good, and she thought, "This fruit is not only beautiful, delicious, but also precious, because it will open my mind". In that moment Eva forgot all the Lord's instructions. Eva forgot that God made it clear that "if you eat, you will surely die." Eva walked to the Tree of Knowledge, reached for a fruit, took a bite, and gave it to Adam, who ate it as well. It was true that they did not die right away, but by disobeying, they rejected eternal life themselves. As they opened their eyes, they realized things they had never known before. They realized they were naked and felt ashamed for the first time in their lives. They knew that they had made a mistake, and when they could not hide all their shame and fear, they hid in the bushes. "Adam, where are you?" God called. "Here I am, Lord," said Adam. "I heard your steps in the garden and I am scared because I am naked, so I hid." "How do you know you're naked?" God asked. "Did you eat the fruit of that forbidden tree and then you know that?" "It is this woman," Adam said. "Eva gave me some of that and I ate it." God turned to Eva: "Why did you do that?" Mercifully he asked Eva. "The snake itself," the woman said. "That snake tempted me so I ate." Adam and Eve disobeyed. God only required obedience and they did not meet his requirements. God looked at the snake and immediately recognized that was Lilith. He pointedly pointed at Lilith and said: "Because you did this, you will be exiled to The Hell (Abandon). You and this woman, and your descendants and her descendants will be perpetual enemies of each other." He said to Eva: "I will increase your hardships when you are pregnant, and you will have more pains when you give birth. However, you still want to live with your husband, and your husband will help you." After that, he said to Adam, "Because you have listened to your wife's words, ate the fruit that I had forbidden, the land will be cursed because of you. The earth will produce thorns and thistles, and you will eat the vegetables in the field. You will have to sweat your forehead to have food, until you return to the land where you came from. As you are dust, you will return to dust ". God used animal skin to form a long dress for Adam and Eve and then ordered Khamuel - who stand before God (Khamuel is the Archangel of the strength, courage and war in Heaven) to bring Eva and Adam out of the Garden of Eden Worried for the descendants of mankind, before leaving the Garden of Eden, Adam asked the archangel Khamuel to meet Auriel - Guardian of wisdom - so that he could humanity teach to fight Lilith. human for not able to fight Lilith - who receives help from Samael - Satan, prince of The Hell - exile (Abandon) Auriel gave Adam the blessing of wisdom, wide vision, and insight At the same time, Auriel also asked Khamuel to give Eva a drop of Khamuel's blood, so that the descendants of the human race could unlock the potential of strength, courage and fighting skills Auriel manipulate two people: “Your bodies are only human. Angel's skills are very difficult for humans to manipulate. But you can cooperate an</p>
